# Parity Dockerfiles

Collection of the company's Dockerfiles that are used by Parity in different ways. If you work on a Polkadot SDK-based project, you could be interested in our CI image (`ci-unified`).

### Additional information

* We use the `ci-unified` image for most of our CI pipelines (including the pipelines for Polkadot SDK-based/Polkadot SDK-related projects and Polkadot SDK itself). You can find more information about the image in the `ci-unified` directory.
* Most of the images are published to Docker Hub and could be found in [Docker Hub organization](https://hub.docker.com/u/paritytech).
